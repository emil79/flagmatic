Flagmatic 2.0
=============

A package for the Sage system.

To install, first download and enter the `pkg` directory of the download:

    $ cd pkg

Then, assuming the command `sage` is in your `PATH`, type:

    $ sage -pip install -e .

(Replace `sage` by whatever you use to start Sage from the command line
if necessary.)

Finally, to use flagmatic, start Sage and type this in the Sage prompt:

    sage: from flagmatic.all import *
